This repository demonstrates a common performance pitfall in C++: using std::vector<bool> when a std::bitset would be far more efficient.  std::vector<bool> is often slower because it's not implemented as a simple array of bits; it uses a more complex representation which introduces overhead.  The example code shows a comparison of performance between the two for manipulating a large number of booleans.
